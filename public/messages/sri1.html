        International recently conducted a national study of the U.S. Department 
        of Education's Community Technology Center (CTC) initiative, an initiative 
        aimed at developing model programs that provide effective technology and 
        education programs in underserved urban and rural communities. </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#666666" size="-1">The 
        report: <i>The Organization of Learning in Community Technology Centers: 
        Learning with Technologies in Six Communities</i>, published in March 
        2001, detailed the results of the SRI research. The Spaghetti Book Club, 
        which is offered at the Technology and Learning Center @ the Armory in 
        Washington Heights, New York City, was one of the programs featured in 
        the report and received accolades for being a successful model for integrating 
        technology and literacy.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#666666" size="-1">The 
        full report is available at:<br>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#666666" size="-1">Below 
        are quotes from the report that illustrate the success and effectiveness 
        of the Spaghetti Book Club:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><font color="#990099">&quot;The 
        examples from students who've participated in the program at the TLC@the 
        Armory illustrate the power of the program. The reviews of students are 
        coherent and show the students' understanding of the plot of stories. 
        Their opinions and recommendations show an attention to audience and an 
        ability to reflect on meaningful texts. Their illustrations show their 
        skill in linking visual and print modes of literacy, while at the same 
        time providing the students with an opportunity to express themselves 
        creatively.&quot;</font></b></font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#990099" size="-1"><b>&quot;Part 
        of the success of the Spaghetti Book Club owes to how much it draws from 
        what we know about how young children learn how to read and write. In 
        this early literacy program, students get to pick their own children's 
        book to review. The students' book reviews call for them not just to summarize 
        their books as in a book report but also to provide their own opinion 
        of the book and make recommendations to others about the book.&quot;</b></font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font color="#990099" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>"What 
        is unusual about the project is that students really engage excitedly 
        in the process of writing and revision. Even in the after-school hours, 
        nearly all the participants observed were actively engaged in revising 
        and improving reviews they'd already begun. The project takes students 
        through a single book and, through iteration, students develop a more 
        coherent and polished review."</b></font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#990099" size="-1"><b>&quot;At 
        different stages during the review process, students review each other's 
        work and provide suggestions for improvement. Each of these strategies 
        - peer review, connecting to personal experience, and studying of one's 
        own choosing - is important in a learner-centered approach.&quot;</b></font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#990099" size="-1"><b>&quot;In 
        programs like the Urban Voice in Oakland, the Spaghetti Book Club in New 
        York, and the after-school robotics classes in Columbia, program developers 
        have blended their understanding of how people learn with their understanding 
        of how people develop and grow through the opportunities and supports 
        for taking responsibility for learning that can be provided in community-based 
        organizations.&quot;</b></font></p>
