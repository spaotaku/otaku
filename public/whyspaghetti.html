      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People always ask, &quot;Why 
        is the book club called the Spaghetti' Book Club?&quot; or &quot;How did 
        the Spaghetti Book Club get it's name?&quot; Well, here's the story....</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Spaghetti Book Club started 
        when I was teaching 1st grade in a public school in New York City (P.S. 
        41 in Greenwich Village). My students were writing book reviews as a way 
        for them to write about the books they were reading and share their thoughts 
        and opinions with their families and friends. We published a book of the 
        reviews and called it &quot;A Booklet of Book Reviews by Class 1-213&quot;. 
        (Our class was referred to as 1-213 because we were a first grade class 
        in room 213.) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We discussed ways that we could 
        share the book reviews with more people and decided to put the book reviews 
        on the Internet so that family members, friends and kids around the world 
        could read the reviews too. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
        we put the reviews on the web, the site looked very different from what 
        it looks like now. It was just a page of titles that linked to the reviews. 
        We planned a publishing celebration in the classroom and invited all the 
        students' family members, but we didn't have a name for the web site. 
        The kids suggested names like &quot;Class 1-213's Book Reviews&quot;. 
        I thought that was a little plain and ordinary, and suggested that we 
        come up with a more interesting name. I told my students how when I was 
        younger I worked in a kids' clothing store that was called &quot;Peanut 
        Butter&quot;; not &quot;Kids Clothing Store&quot;, and everyone knew it 
        was a store for kids. They wanted to think of a fun name like that.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We decided to come up with 
        a list of fun kids' words and vote on which one would be the name. Some 
        of the words they came up with included: <b>ice cream, lollipop, spaghetti, 
        marshmallow, cotton candy, bubble gum</b> and others. I think the reason 
        why the words were all food words was because of my story about the store, 
        Peanut Butter. Well, I'm sure you've figured out the rest. The class voted 
        and Spaghetti got the most votes!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I love to tell this story because 
        the name came from the kids in my class. That was my last year teaching 
        in the classroom (1995-1996); however, I still see many of my former students 
        since I live in near the school, as they do. They are much older now but 
        they always remember that class project and get a kick out knowing that 
        they helped name the site. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We'd love to hear what you 
        think of the name Spaghetti Book Club. Why did you think it was called 
        Spaghetti Book Club before you heard the story? Let us know by emailing 
        us at: <a href="mailto:%22staff@spaghettibookclub.org%22">staff@spaghettibookclub.org</a>.</font></p>
