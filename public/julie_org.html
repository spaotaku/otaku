         <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="helvetica,arial,sans-serif" COLOR="#6918AB"><B>Hello,
         and welcome to the Spaghetti Book Club. I hope you've
         enjoyed reading our book reviews. If you haven't yet browsed
         our reviews, please do! You'll probably find interesting
         books to read yourself or enjoy with a child you know. Or
         maybe, like I do, you'll enjoy reading the kids' thoughts
         about the books they've read and enjoy looking at their
         incredible illustrations! </B></FONT></P>
         
         
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="helvetica,arial,sans-serif" COLOR="#6918AB"><B>The 
          Spaghetti Book Club has been an exciting adventure for me. It began 
          when I was teaching at P.S. 41 (Greenwich Village, NYC) as a way to 
          encourage my first grade students to reflect on and discuss the books 
          they were reading. Our class would have interesting conversations about 
          books, what the stories made us think of, how they made us feel and 
          how they were like other books we had read. Writing book reviews was 
          a way for my students to share their thoughts, opinions and reactions 
          with other kids and family members. Through the process of having thoughtful 
          book talks and writing reviews, my students developed sophisticated 
          ways of reflecting on what they were reading. </B></FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="helvetica,arial,sans-serif" COLOR="#6918AB"><B>When
         we published the reviews on the web, the project took off!
         The kids told me they felt "famous" knowing that their
         family members, friends and kids around the world could read
         their work. The class got a flood of email from family
         members and friends expressing their praise and
         encouragement.</B></FONT></P>
         
         
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="helvetica,arial,sans-serif" COLOR="#6918AB"><B>I 
          never imagined all the joy, excitement and pride that the kids and their 
          families would experience. Of course, it was a thrill for me to see 
          their reactions and to watch them become enthusiastic, confident and 
          reflective readers!</B></FONT></P>
         
         
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="helvetica,arial,sans-serif" COLOR="#6918AB"><B>The 
          enthusiasm of my students and the encouragement from their families 
          and friends inspired me to later develop this project into one for all 
          kids, teachers and families to participate in and enjoy. </B></FONT></P>
