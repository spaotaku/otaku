            by kids for kids. The Spaghetti Book Club was created as a way to 
            support and encourage kids' love for reading by giving them an opportunity 
            to connect, on a personal level, with the books they are reading and 
            then share their reactions, thoughts, and opinions with family members, 
            friends, and kids around the world.</font></P>

            Book Club is an innovative literacy program that integrates reading, 
            writing, art and technology by teaching students how to write and 
            illustrate book reviews. Much to their delight, the reviews are then 
            published on the Spaghetti Book Club web site. <br>

            dialogue with teachers and peers; express their opinions and reactions 
            in conversation and writing; and write for an intended audience. At

            Spaghetti Book Club offers curriculum, training and web publishing 
            services to schools, after-school programs and libraries. The curriculum 
            consists of standards-based lesson plans to help teachers guide their 
            students through the process of writing and publishing book reviews. 
            Through this process, students learn to make personal connections 
            to what they are reading, summarize stories, construct meaning from 
            text, express their opinions and reactions, and compare literary works.

            compare, critique, and express reactions to literary work. The Spaghetti 
            Book Club provides a unique way to help students meet those standards 
            through its curriculum and publishing criteria. The Spaghetti Book 
            Club staff reads all book reviews to ensure that they meet explicit

            student work on the web motivates and inspires kids to do their best 
            work. When kids know that people around the world will be able to 
            read their reviews, they put a lot of thought and effort into their 
            work. When kids see their reviews and artwork on the web, many express 
            that they feel "famous". They giggle, smile and are eager to read 
            their own reviews and those of their friends. They often go right 
            to the Spaghetti Clubhouse (the online bulletin board) to post messages 
            to each other to share their thoughts and reactions to reading their 
            friends' reviews creating an online community that exists outside

            the process of writing book reviews, students read and reread books; 
            engage in book talks with their classmates and teachers; and write 
            summaries, opinions, and recommendations. By publishing on the web, 
            students feel that their opinions and reactions are important! They 
            know other people will be reading their reviews and write with their 
            audience in mind. Because their reviews must meet explicit publishing 
            criteria, kids feel a sense of pride and accomplishment when their
