          Spaghetti Book Club is unlike any other literacy or technology project 
          I've done. It was a hit with my students, and one of the best uses of 
          internet technology I've come across. The lessons were well planned, 
          easy to use, and best of all, already a key part of my curriculum. Thank 
          you! : )&quot;</b></font></P>

          first graders became enthusiastic writers and artists once they saw 
          reviews on-line. �They worked diligently to get their work published 
          and tried to meet criteria so their work would make it to electronic 
          print. �This was an excellent way to integrate reading, writing, art 
          and technology. �The SBC also gave us the opportunity to go beyond our 
          classroom and share with others around the world (we hope). �It was 
          a great way to show our parents and community that education can be 
          more than reading a textbook! �I hope and will work to see that writing 
          book reviews for the SBC becomes a yearly part of my first grade curriculum.&quot;</font></b>

          Spaghetti Book Club provided my class with a rare opportunity to publish 
          their writing for a real audience. My students are beaming with pride 
          about having their work on line, and the staff at Spaghetti Book Club 
          made the process incredibly easy for me by developing such user friendly 
          on line forms. I was able to enter the student work from my own desktop, 
          at a time that was convenient for me. In fact, now that know how easy 
          it is, I know that, in most cases, my fifth grade students could have 
          entered their own work, thereby saving me even more time and giving 
          the kids experience with online forms. Thank You Spaghetti Book Club

          used this program with some of my students who are struggling readers. 
          They were thrilled to see their review and felt honored that other students 
          were reading their writing and then reading the books that they had 
          suggested. It was a real self-esteem boost for some kids who aren't 
          normally recognized for their reading ability.&quot;</font></b></P>
