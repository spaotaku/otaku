      <p align="center"><font color="#660066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"><b>Corporate 
        Sponsorship</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Corporate 
        sponsorships are available for companies interested in supporting literacy 
        and the meaningful use of technology among elementary school children. 
        By sponsoring a school, a company has the unique opportunity to encourage 
        and develop children's love for reading, improve children's reading and 
        writing skills, and see the results of their support on the web.</font> 
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Individuals, 
        corporations and small businesses can sponsor or &quot;adopt&quot; a school 
        by underwriting fees for membership in the Spaghetti Book Club. Sponsors 
        can have their generosity and commitment to literacy recognized in writing 
        on the school and class home pages that they sponsor (<a href="http://www.spaghettibookclub.org/class.php?class_id=1035">click 
        here for an example</a>). Sponsors may also have their logos appear on 
        the school and class pages which they support. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In addition, 
        there are many wonderful and exciting ways for sponsors to increase the 
        visibility of their commitment to improving student literacy. For example, 
        a local business could display printouts of the students' reviews in their 
        windows or host a "publishing party" to celebrate the students' hard work 
        and accomplishments. Also, the sponsor can create a link to the Spaghetti 
        Book Club from its own web site so that visitors to their site can read 
        the students' work and learn about the sponsor's commitment to student 
        literacy in the community. </font></p>
